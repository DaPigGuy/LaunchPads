# LaunchPads
Make any block a launchpad

# Configuration
To change a launchpad, go to config.yml and change launchpad to the id of the block you want. If you want to make a launchpad launch a player a certain direction, make sure enable-torch-mose is set to true, then place a torch under the launchpad facing the direction you want.
